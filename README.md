## Fullstack Todo App

This is my single prject. That is a fullstack Todo web app where the user can post, get, read and delete his todos.

Tools Back End:
Node.js, Postgress, Heroku.

Tools Front End:
React.

Installation:
To download thise code you need to press a green button Code and choose copy a link to use your terminal and clone the repository: `git clone <<link>>` or just download a zip folder and opent it through VS Code or any other code editor. To start your server use commands `cd server` to enter into server folder, than `npm i install` all dependencies and install package json, run the server using command `npm start` to run server. Don't forget to add your own envoronment variables to .env file, and than add .env file to .gitignore. Now when you started your server you can run React files, in the terminal `cd front-end` than `cd todo-app`, to install all dependencies for front end you need again run that command `npm i`.
